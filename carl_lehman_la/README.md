# Problem Statement:
For this project, I chose to use my model for inference, by giving advice to homeowners in Aimes Iowa on how to improve the sale price of their homes.

# Conclusion:
It was found that some of the most heavily weighted features in my model included kitchen quality, screen porch size, and year remodeled, and thus recommended to home owners that they remodeled their kitchen or porch.

# Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplolib, seaborn
