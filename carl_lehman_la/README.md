# Problem Statement:
This project is based on a kaggle competition, where participants are given data on the features (i.e. sq. ft., number of baths, etc.) of a house in Aimes Iowa, and challenged to create a model that can accurately predict the sales price. I wanted to take this competition a step further, and create a model that would be mainly used for inference. For instance, if we look at the features of a model that does a good job of predicting the sales price of a house, we can infer that the most heavily weighted features are the most important for determining the price, and we can give this information to home owners in Aimes Iowa who are seeking to flip their house.

# Conclusion:
It was found that some of the most heavily weighted features in my model included kitchen quality, screen porch size, and year remodeled, and thus recommended to home owners that they remodeled their kitchen or porch. My model also had the 15th lowest root mean squared error out of 100 students in the competition. 

# Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplolib, seaborn
